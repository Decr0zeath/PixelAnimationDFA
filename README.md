# Pixel Animation DFA

This project simulates a knight character's animation using a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA).
It is built with C# and Windows Forms.

## Features

- Knight animations: Idle, Running, Crouching, Rolling, Attacking
- State transitions based on keyboard input
- Visualization of state diagram
- Responsive resizing for different screen sizes
