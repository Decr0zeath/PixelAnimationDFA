---

A **C# Windows Forms** project simulating a knight’s animation using a **State Machine**.  
An interactive experience combining **game development** and **theory of computation** — all in real time.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Smooth Knight Animations:** Idle, Running, Crouching, Rolling, Attacking
- **NFA-Based State Machine:** Transitions controlled strictly by NFA logic
- **Responsive UI:** Scales across different screen sizes
- **Toggle Visualization:** Knight animation ↔ State Diagram
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean code structure for easy maintenance and expansion

## 📖 Technical Insights

This project implements **State Machines** model to govern the knight’s state transitions based on player input.  
Each input event triggers a transition, keeping behavior **predictable, structured, and mathematically sound** — mirroring real-world finite automaton behavior used in AI, language parsing, and embedded systems.
